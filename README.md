## Social media and Generative AI
### Build a new algorithm using generative AI to detect deep fake videos and fake news on social media.

### Overview:  
One major issue is the potential for the creation and spread of fake news and misinformation through generative AI-powered content. AI-generated content can be manipulated to create fake news and false information that is designed to deceive and mislead social media users.

Addressing these challenges and concerns will require a multi-faceted approach that involves collaboration between social media platforms, AI developers, and regulators.
Develop new algorithms and technologies to detect and prevent the spread of fake news and deep fake videos, implement stronger privacy and consent policies, and educate users about the risks and potential benefits of generative AI on social media.
